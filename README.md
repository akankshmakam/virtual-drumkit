# Virtual Drumkit

This Python application creates a virtual drumkit using computer vision, tkinter, mediapipe, and pygame. It tracks fingers and plays drum sounds when two different fingers come in contact.

## Features

- Virtual drumkit with multiple drum sounds
- Finger tracking using mediapipe
- User-friendly GUI built with tkinter
- Real-time drum sound playback using pygame

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- mediapipe
- tkinter
- pygame

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-drumkit.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python airdrums.py
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the GUI to start playing the virtual drumkit.

## How It Works

1. The application uses mediapipe to track the user's fingers in real-time.

2. When two different fingers come in contact, a drum sound is triggered.

3. The GUI displays the virtual drumkit and provides visual feedback when a drum sound is played.
